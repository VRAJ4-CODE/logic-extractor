# logic-extractor
The logic extraction and code manipulation mini-project aims to develop a tool that can automatically extract and manipulate specific elements from C code, including
loops, inputs, outputs, functions, as well as remove libraries from the code and facilitate the transfer of code snippets between different files while considering read and write command permissions. The project encompasses various techniques from program analysis, code transformation, and file management to achieve these goals.The tool will utilize techniques such as lexical and syntactic analysis to parse the C code
and construct an abstract syntax tree .
